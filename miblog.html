                <h5>Interview with Paulus Erasmus - Walking 4 Jesus</h5>
                <p>As reported last year, Paulus Erasmus (Walking 4 Jesus), visited us at the Basic In Discipleship boat (BID). Paulus is on a mission for sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout South Africa. His ministry is called - Walking 4 Jesus - and he walks from town to town to share the gospel, distribute Bibles and prayer materials and to establish prayer groups.<br/>He plants crosses in the towns he visits to remind people of the importance of the cross as a symbol of the price that Christ has paid for us all.<br/>Paulus prays for companies and has had the opportunity to be a guest speaker at schools and other venues during his travels throughout the country. We thank God for Paulus and pray for God's wisdom and guidance as he continues on his missionary journey!<br/>Below are two videos we filmed while Paulus visited us. The first video is an interview we had with Paulus where he shares his ministry travels with us. In the second video Paulus demonstrates the push-cart that he walks with from town to town. It is very interesting to see how he uses this "contraption" in his travels!
                <br/>Paulus has a Facebook group which you can view or join by clicking on: <a class="navlink"  href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/829900377945668/?ref=share" target="_blank">Paulus on Facebook</a><br/>
                <br/>Should you wish to get in contact with Paulus for a speaking engagement or other ministry needs, please ask for him (mention his name and send a brief note) on: <a class="navlink" href="/index.html#contactus" title="Contact us">ContactUs</a>

                <h5>Weskus Mall Outreach - 31 March 2022</h5>
                <p>On 31 March 2022, a successful evangelism outreach was done at the Weskus Mall, Vredenburg. It was a particularly blessed outreach with a number of positive personal evangelism encounters and many tracts distributed to shoppers at various shops inside the Mall. We give glory to the Lord Jesus Christ for every soul that repents and comes into the Kingdom of God!<br/>One person requested and received a Shona language Bible and we tried out our new wallet tract for the first time as well. The wallet tract unfolds twice to reveal text that contains moral questions as well as a gospel presentation that you can leave anywhere and people will pick it up due to its uniqueness.<br/><br/>The Lord Jesus is faithful and we trust God for at least one soul for every tract distributed. We base our faith for the salvation of souls - as we labour in His service - in His promises to us that His word will succeed!<br/>Isaiah 55:11 Amplified Bible, Classic Edition; 11 So shall My word be that goes forth out of My mouth: it shall not return to Me void [without producing any effect, useless], but it shall accomplish that which I please and purpose, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</p>

                <p>We recently started a feeding initiative for needy and vulnerable children. As many as 30 children receive food on the discipleship boat (BID) on a regular basis as the need dictates.<br/>We also give the children spiritual food as we interact with them.<br/>Here is a photo of a group of young children receiving the Gospel of Jesus Christ and a copy of the Gospel, according to John in the Afrikaans language - their mother tongue. We rejoice and relish the opportunity to minister to these young ones.<br/>As the Bible teaches us in the accompanying Scripture; Proverbs 22:6 (King James Version)  "6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."<br/><br/>Praise be to God for the opportunities he daily sends us!</p>

                <h5>Is handing out gospel tracts a good evangelism method?</h5>
                <p>The goal of a gospel tract is to get the gospel of salvation of Jesus Christ into peoples' hands in an interesting and easy-to-read format. While the precise origin of gospel tracts is uncertain, there are records of them as early as the 13th century A.D. Gospel tracts were popularized during the Protestant Reformation, and the invention of the printing press made mass-production of tracts much easier and faster. The most well-known gospel tract is likely “The Four Spiritual Laws” written by Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ.<br/><br/>Gospel tracts can be a very effective method of evangelism. Again, if the biblical gospel is presented in a clear and understandable manner, God will use it (Isaiah 55:11). Any time God's Word goes forth, it is powerful and effective (Hebrews 4:12). People who are not otherwise effective communicators can overcome such a challenge by use of a gospel tract. Gospel tracts are an excellent choice when you simply do not have time to stop and witness to someone. Gospel tracts can be left in strategic locations for people to pick up later and read  (credit www.gotquestions.org)<br/><br/>If you are looking to get involved or get training in this form of evangelism, please get in touch with us and we will help to equip you to do so. Attached are a few photos of some interesting people we met whilst handing out tracts as well as examples of some of the tracts we use.</p>

                <h5>We have had a very special visitor recently.</h5>
                <p>Paulus Erasmus visited us on 11 November 2021 and we had the privilege to host Paulus as our first travelling evangelist/missionary to stay over at our boat.<br/>Paulus is on a mission for sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout South Africa. His initiative is called - Walking for Jesus - and he walks from town to town to share the gospel and to distribute Bibles and prayer materials, to establish and plant prayer groups as well as to plant crosses in the towns he visits to remind people of the importance of the cross as a symbol of the price that Christ had paid for us all.<br/>Paulus prays for companies and have had the opportunity to be a guest speaker at schools and other venues during his travels throughout the country.<br/>We thank Paulus for visiting us and pray for God's wisdom and guidance as he continues on his missionary journey!</p>
